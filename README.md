## Wordle Solver

The aim is to make an algorithm that solves wordle in a pretty optimal way, it need not be the most optimal way. And after that develop an interface that interacts directly with the new york times wordle puzzle and solve it.

The word list I am using if from 'dracos' from his [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/dracos/dd0668f281e685bad51479e5acaadb93). I know that the OG Wordle guys had released the list according to [Matt Parker's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w) on this topic, but I have not personally verified the claim, but from my trial and error tries, all the words work on the New York Times Wordle.
